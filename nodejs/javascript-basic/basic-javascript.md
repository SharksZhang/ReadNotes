# basic javascript

1. javascript data types are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

2. When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
    - If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". 
    - If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of undefined.
