Q&A on the Book Refactoring - Second Edition

#### Key Takeaways

- Refactoring is a book for relatively new developers to learn a key practice in order to be effective developers (and a book to help senior developers teach this practice)
- The second edition carries much of the same message, but is less centered on objects and includes examples in JavaScript (although the book isn’t tied to any particular language)
- Even making complex changes can be plausible, by breaking down the change into small, behavior-preserving steps
- We use the metaphor of a (bad) smell to indicate code that needs refactoring; these include duplication and complex conditionals
- Refactoring can play an important part in code reviews, provided it is done quickly

#### Are there refactorings which can be rather challenging to do? How can developers take precaution doing them?

I don't see particular refactorings as more challenging than others，**Where you get variation in difficulty is how the same refactoring varies with context and scope.**
