#### **Creational Patterns**

1. **Abstract Factory**:  Creates an instance of several families of classes. Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
2. **Builder**: Separates object construction from its representation. Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.
3. **Factory Method**: Creates an instance of several derived classes. Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
4. **Prototype**: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned. Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
5. **Singleton:** A class of which only a single instance can exist. Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

#### **Structural Patterns**

1. **Adapter**: Match interfaces of different classes.Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
2. **Bridge**: Separates an object’s interface from its implementation. Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
3. **Composite:** A tree structure of simple and composite objects. Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
4. **Decorator**: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.  Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a             flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
5. **Facade:** A single class that represents an entire subsystem. Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a system. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
6. **Flyweight:** A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing. Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context — it’s indistinguishable from an instance of the object that’s not shared.
7. **Proxy:** An object representing another object. Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

#### **Behavioral Patterns**

1. **Chain of Resp**. : A way of passing a request between a chain of objects. Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a  chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
2. **Command:** Encapsulate a command request as an object. Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
3. **Interpreter**: A way to include language elements in a program. Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
4. **Iterator**: Sequentially access the elements of a collection. Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes. Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
6. **Memento**: Capture and restore an object's internal state. Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
7. **Observer**: A way of notifying change to a number of classes. Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
8. **State**: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes. Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
9. **Strategy**: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class. Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.            Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
10. **Template:** Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass. Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm’s structure.
11. **Visitor:** Defines a new operation to a class without change. Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

### 对比

#### 1. 工厂方法模式 vs 建造者模式 vs抽象工厂模式

工厂方法模式注重的是整体对象的创建方法， 而建造者模式注重的是部件构建的过程

不同点：

- 意图不同

  1. 在工厂方法模式里， 我们关注的是一个产品整体

  2.  但在建造者模式中， 一个具体产品的产生是依赖各个部件的产生以及装配顺序， 它关注的是“由零件一步一步地组装出产品对象”。
  3. 抽象工厂模式实现对产品家族的创建， 

- 产品的复杂度不同

  - 工厂方法模式创建的产品一般都是单一性质产品， 如成年超人， 都是一个模样， 而建造 者模式创建的则是一个复合产品， 它由各个部件复合而成， 部件不同产品对象当然不同。 



#### 代理模式vs装饰模式 

区别：

1. 代理模式是把当前的行为或功能委托给其他对象执行， 代理类负责接口限定： 是否可以调用真实角色， 以及是否对发送到真实角色的消息进行变形处理， 它不对被主题角色（也就是被代理类） 的功能做任何处理， 保证原汁原味的调用。 
2. 装饰模式是在要保证接口不变的情况下加强类的功能， 它保证的是被修饰的对象功能比原始对象丰富



代理模式让被代理对象只专注于自己的业务，由代理类去做其它不相关的业务。而装饰者模式是对员工能的增强。

#### 装饰模式 vs 适配器模式

- 意图不同
  - 装饰模式的意图是加强对象的功能，
  - 适配器模式关注的则是转化，
